Usage: lino openmail FILE

Start the user's default mail client with a ready-to-send message whose
content is previously read from FILE. FILE describes the contents of the
message using a simplified pseudo RFC822 format. Supported message header
fields are "to", "subject", and the "body". "to" is mandatory, the other
fields are optional.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LOGFILE, --logfile=LOGFILE
                        log a report to FILE
  -v, --verbose         increase verbosity
  -q, --quiet           decrease verbosity
  -b, --batch           not interactive (don't ask anything)
  --lang=LANG           set user language to LANG
