The most used TIM Tools include:

  * prn2pdf.exe and prnprint.exe to print classical text-mode reports on printers without text support.

  * sync.exe makes backups and mirror copies. sync.py is a simple directory synchronizer. It is almost like `xcopy /s/d` on Windows, except that it also deletes the files on the destination that no longer exist on the source.
