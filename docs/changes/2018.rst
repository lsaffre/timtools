==========

We released version 2.0.0 which fixes a problem in the :cmd:`openmail`
command: that command wrote its temporary file using cp850 encoding,
now it uses UTF-8.

The version bump is because now we use pyinstaller for creating the
:xfile:`timtools.zip` file and that now the source code is publicly
available on GitHub.

**Warning** : this is the first release of the 2.0 series and it
potentially contains regression bugs which break things.  For example
it includes only the commands :cmd:`sync`, :cmd:`prnprint`,
:cmd:`prn2pdf` and :cmd:`openmail` because these are the only ones we
know to be used.  If you discover that your TIM actually uses some
other timtools command, let us know.

See :doc:`/install` for installation instructions.
