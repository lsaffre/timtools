"""
make_invoices() creates invoices. 

These new invoices are not yet signed. 
A user must sign them using the web interface before they can be sent.

send_invoices() then "sends" the signed invoices:
  - create a PDF version 
  - send this to a printer (for regular mail channel) 
    or directly via e-mail to the customer.
